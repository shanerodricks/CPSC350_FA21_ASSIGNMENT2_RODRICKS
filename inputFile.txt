Students study core data structures and algorithms, such as arrays, stacks, lists, queues, 
trees, hash tables, graphs; search and sort. Students engage on projects that involve individually 
chosen advanced data structures and algorithms. The focus is on applications of data structures 
and algorithms, utilization of existing practical data sets, and performance tradeoffs.
